      <h5>
        Hello and welcome! My name is Chris Legette. My career began in 2011 as
        a Logistics Officer with the U.S. Army. After a few years of service and a
        deployment to Qatar, I joined the civilian workforce to manage
        operations for companies in various industries such as aerospace
        manufacturing, distribution, and IT services. <br />
        <br /> I enjoy using technology while at work and at home...especially
        if it makes something easier! <br />
        <br /> The ultimate goal is to leverage my passion for technology and my
        experience in operations to begin a new career in software engineering.
