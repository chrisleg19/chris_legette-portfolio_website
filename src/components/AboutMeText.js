            <h5>Hello and welcome!  My name is Chris Legette.  My professional career began in 2011 when I commissioned as a Logistics Officer with the U.S. Army.  
      After a deployment to Qatar in 2014, I joined the civilian workforce and managed 
      operations for a few companies in various industries such as aerospace manufacturing, 
      distribution, and IT services.  <br/><br/>  I enjoy using technology while at work and at home...especially if it makes something easier! <br/><br/>  With the help of Per Scholas, the ultimate goal is to leverage my passion for 
        technology and my experience in operations to begin a new career in 
        development and solving problems.</h5>
